# SpaceX Database
> A Vue.js project to practice retrieving data from an API while building a sleek (SpaceX-ish) UI!

**Goal**
- Build a full informative website on SpaceX's free API
- Provide SpaceX's Milestones, launches, Missions, Rockets, Lauching/Landing Pads, Ships and More!

**Roadmap**
- Get it all out! Setup routes and get data displayed! (not pretty)
- Develop Search/Filtering in "Launches" page
- Complete Formatting for Launches
- Complete Formatting for Rockets
- Add loading spinner for Launches
- IE Compatability
- Mobile Compatibility (Initially I wasnt thinking Mobile First, bit me in the butt!)
- Accessibility
- Launch Pads, Landing Pads, Ships Information

**Things I learned**
- Local Search Filtering on Vue
- Filtering on Serverside using QueryStrings
- Vue Routing for multipage apps
-
