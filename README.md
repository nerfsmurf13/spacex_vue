**Goal**

- Provide SpaceX's Milestones, launches, Missions, Rockets, Lauching/Landing Pads, Ships and More!

**Roadmap**
- Get it all out! Setup routes and get data displayed! (not pretty)
- Develop Search/Filtering in "Launches" page
- Complete Formatting for Launches

**Things I learned**
- Local Search Filtering on Vue
- Filtering on Serverside using QueryStrings
-
